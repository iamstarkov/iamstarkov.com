# Every technical article must have publish date

Everytime I read article without publish date I feel myself uncomfortable.
Modern frontend world is very fast changing thing; new javascript frameworks
are inventing every month, tens npm-packages are publishing everyday and useful
approaches become outdated in a months.

That’s why it’s important to know when article you are reading was published,
because if it’s about something concrete approach or framework and article is
one year old. Then probably you should not read it at all.

Have respect to your readers and show publish date. Probably the best place
is a start of the article.

# npm scripts basics

_19 june 2015_

package.json can have [`scripts` fields](scripts), which are basically an object similar to this one:

      "scripts": {
        "name": "command-to-run",
        "name1": "command-to-run1",
        "name2": "command-to-run2"
      }

npm does a really simple job: when you run `npm run smth`, npm searches "smth" in "scripts" object and runs appropriate `command-to-run`.

## shortcuts: start and test

    npm start # npm run start
    npm test  # npm run test

These commands are common and widely accepted way to start and test nodejs applications or packages.

## pre and post scripts

npm also can run some scripts right before or after others:
* `pretest` will be executeted everytime before `test`
* `postpublish` will be executeted everytime after `publish`

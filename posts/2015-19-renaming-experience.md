# Renaming experience

_5 may 2015_

![Squatters @ Squatters everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/q8LcWMw.jpg)

I used to have "@matmuchrapna" username, but now you will find me
as [@iamstarkov][iamstarkov]. I successfully renamed myself
on internet and want to share my experience. I’m assuming that you want to have
the same username on domain, mail, social media and messengers. If you
have trademark, skip entire article.

## Top level domain '.com'

You can get domain *username.com* if it’s available or squatted. In case
of squatting you’d better to have extra money. If *username.com* is
available, then check this username on social media, because it can be
squatted there too.

## Mail (gmail in my case)

You can get username *only if it’s available*. In this case renaming is
registering new account.

## Social media

### Twitter

You can get username *only if it’s available*. Twitter support is
awfull. You will not get any reply from them. Also you will not get
username of suspended user. Twitter will not redirect users from your
previous account to new one.

### GitHub

You can get username *only if it is available or it’s owned by activeless user*.
GitHub support is awesome. GitHub will not redirect users from your
previous account to new one, but will do it for repositories. All of the
README’s badges will be broken.

### npm

npm support is great too, e.g. I got answers from Isaac Shueltz—npm’s founder.
npm helped me with moving all the packages from prev account to the new one.
Obviously npm deleted my previous account.

### Stackoverflow

You don’t need to change anything here.

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is great on renaming, easy and without any side-effects.

### Gravatar

Don’t forget about avatar for the new email.

## Messengers

### Telegram

You can get username *only if it’s available*.

### Skype

Like gmail — [the only way to be
renamed](http://community.skype.com/t5/Rates-and-subscriptions/Change-Skype-username/td-p/673113)
is to register new username.

## Summary

Define list of social networks and list of usernames to check. Choose one,
which is available everywhere. Renaming Gmail requires extra work.

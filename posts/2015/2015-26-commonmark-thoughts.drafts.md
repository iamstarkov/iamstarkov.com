# Thoughts about commonmark

_June 22, 2015_

where is any support from github or stackoverflow?

I used to think that commonmark appeared to be standard specification for markdown documents,
withsupport from core markdown users from the net like StackOverflow or GitHub, but instead
commonmark is maintaining by only one @jgm (thank you for this very much).

It is good enough to use, but it’s _not enough to compete with another md libraries_:
README is not full, API design and it’s documentation can be better. C-implementaion
is not in sync with JS one, github issues ignored for months. So much rooms to improve.
Where are big players when they are needed?

Please get me right, I love to use commonmark, I use it in a lot of my open source project,
I love to contribute, but it’s hard without proper tests (e.g. for AST tree) and detailed
docs (API docs is lacking) — it’s not the only things which is lacking, but they are very important.

Also commonmark has very weak community, just compare commonmark’s community to babel or
postcss’ ones. Contributing process is lacking too: "Use the github issue tracker only
for simple, clear, actionable issues". Probably, you are doing github wrong.

Finally, where is roadmap?

All of these makes me sad

why dingus is encapsulated into commonmark?

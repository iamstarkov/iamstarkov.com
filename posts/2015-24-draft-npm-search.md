# We do need better npm search

_16 june 2015_

How many packages did you wrote mainly because you didn’t find neccessary
package in npm? Why community are maintaining awesome lists
and one awesome-awesome one?

npm search sucks, that is the answer. It’s okay, because we can still
use npm itself. It’s okay because we _still_ can use npm search. Probably
the reason of npm search is npm exponential growth. Basically npm growth
is a good news, from the other side if we already have a problem, then
in the future we will have only bigger problems.

When I’m thinking about this problem, I’m not sure how to solve it.

Probably we need more search results on a page. Keywords have good potential,
but unfortunately not used anywhere. Maybe moderated categories will help
us to find out required package. Maybe "packages recommended for you",
"last viewed packages" or even "with this package developers also see
this packages" page sections will help us to find better packages. Also maybe
"popular in this keyword" is not that bad idea.

It’s not a secret that JS community has powerfull influencers and they usually
have great packages to use. So why npm don’t show me that probably this
packages are better then others, relying on maintainer field. At least
if npm will have authors’ userpics in search results, this will help me
a lot to determine what packages I should checkout first.

Regardless to all of these, npm should encourage community-driven awesome lists.
This approach have hidden side-effect that popular packages will be even more
popular, which will increase gap between them and new packages.

Next point is that everybody prefer tested code, so why npm bothering us
to checkout which packages are green and passing tests, and which have
no tests at all. I’m talking not about penalty for not tested packages,
but about praising TDD. Like google praising mobile-friendly sites. Let’s name
tested packages developer-friendly or production-friendly, if you want.

Next important trigger for me is how many lines of code is in a package.

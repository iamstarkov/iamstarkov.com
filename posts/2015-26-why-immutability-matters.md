# Why immutability matters

_28 june 2016_

I’m reading Erlang book and there is a brilliant explanation
why immutability matters.

> Using immutable variables simplifies debugging. To understand why this is
true, we must ask ourselves what an error is and how an error makes itself
known.
> 
> One rather common way that we discover that a program is incorrect is when
we find that a variable has an unexpected value. Once we know which variable
is incorrect, we just have to inspect the program to find the place where the
variable was bound. Since Erlang variables are immutable, the code that
produced the variable must be incorrect. In an imperative language, variables
can be change many times, so every place where the variable was changed
might be the place where the error occured. In Erlang there is only one place
to look.

> At this point, you might wondering how it’s possible to program _without_
mutable variables. How can we express something like `X = X + 1` in Erlang?
The Erlang way is to invent new variable whose name hasn’t been used
before (say `X1`) and to write `X1 = X + 1`.

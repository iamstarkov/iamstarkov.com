# Gmail setup

_12 may 2015_

I discovered that gmail is not very friendly by default. Gmail mark message as
"read" only after 3 seconds, you cannot use it from keyboard and it have
no preview for emails. But slow and abandoned gmail chat is turned on.
Good try, gmail!

My gmail look like this and have hotkeys:

* Disable "gmail" tabs:

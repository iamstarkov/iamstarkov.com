## Colophon

_[iamstarkov.com](https://iamstarkov.com/)_ is built with [gulp][gulp] build
system, have been [opensourced][src] and also hosted on [GitHub pages][pages].

It’s kind of experiment on blog format and modern web, tools,
typography and minimalism. I started with [minimum viable blog](https://iamstarkov.com/mvb/) and gradually
transforming it in my ideal blog.

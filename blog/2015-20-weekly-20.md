# Weekly 20

_16 may 2015_

In short: iojs is joining (new) Node, Elon Musk gives interview, video-selfies
with flying lily, and all you need is PostCSS.

## iojs is joining the Node Foundation

_tldr:_ nothing bad happened, everybody wins.

I have not been prepared for this. I didn’t know what happened, that’s why
I felt myself very insecure. Though I believe that core iojs contributors
will not harm iojs in any way, I feel necessity to understand clear what
just happened. That’s why I wrote separate article about it. [iojs is joining
the Node Foundation. What does it mean?][foundation]

## Talks

### Rise of the Compilers

Last month Brendan Eich had a great talk named "ECMAScript Harmony: Rise
of the Compilers". It was awesome talk about history and future of JavaScript.
And yep, Brendan Eich jokes very well (about js, twitter and C++). Also talk
is not only about BabelJS.

### Build for replace, not for reuse

Actually, I don’t know who is Stefan Tilkov — next talk’s author. But he
definitely knows, what he is talking about. For me it was very useful to view
from a different perspective on system architects. In this talk, Stefan looked
at concepts for turning a single system into a system of systems, and discuss
the architectural und organizational challenges that arise.

I strongly recommend this talk to everyone who build something huge inside
his company. By the way, this talk is not tedious, because Stefan has great
sense of humour and has opinions about Java, JavaScript and development flow.

### PostCSS the Future after Sass and Less

Andrey Sitnik talked about ideas behind [Autoprefixr][ap], [PostCSS][pc].
Also Sitnik answered why you already can use incredible fast PostCSS instead
of old Sass and Less. Simplicity and modularity ftw!
